# kopokopo

Kopo Kopo Inc is a kenyan company that offers a platform to receive and manage mobile payments. 
Please read more here http://kopokopo.co.ke/. This is basic implementation of the Kopo Kopo's 
third party developer(https://app.kopokopo.com/push_api) api using Clojure language.

## Usage

The app is built to receive payment notification sent from the Kopo Kopo system. It receives a post 
notification, validates it, then respond appropriately. You will need to expose the app's transaction endpoint to Kopo Kopo
ie 'http://127.0.0.1:xxxx/v1/transactions' after you have compiled the app using lein uberjar:

    $ java -jar kopokopo-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
        

## TODO

- Add more functionality upon receiving the right notification E.g storing data in the db.
- Better handling of configs.
- Better logging experience.
- Writing tests.
